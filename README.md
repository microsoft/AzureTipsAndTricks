#### Git Workflow
------------

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTE: 

* Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request! 
* Each page has a "Edit this page on GitHub" link. Click it to easily navigate to the blog post file. They are also located in `/src/blog` with a name such as `tip120.md`.
