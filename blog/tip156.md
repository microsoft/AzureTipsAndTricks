### Use Azure Logic Apps to Detect when a new SQL record is inserted

I recently needed the ability to detect when a new SQL record was added and send an email. Since the customer didn't want the existing logic in their app to be modified, I relied on Azure Logic Apps and all their powerful connectors.

In the portal, create a new **Azure Logic App** and then select **Start with a blank template**. Under the trigger, choose **New step > Add an action**.

In the search box, enter "sql" as your filter. and pick **When an item is created**.

You'll be prompted for connection details, so do so now.

Now you'll need to select the **Table Name** and how often you want to check for item. We are going to go with every 5 seconds.

Now choose, **New step > Choose an action**.

In the search box, enter "email" as your filter. and pick **Send an email**.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/logicsql4.png')">

Type the email address and select which fields to send. You can put custom text as shown below:

Now insert a record into your database and it should fire (as long as you have the Logic app running)

<img :src="$withBase('/files/logicsql6.png')">

Easy enough!
