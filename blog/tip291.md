### 5 Things you didn't know about Azure App Service

#### Run your application on Azure App Service
[Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) is a family of Azure services that you use to run your applications. You can use [Azure App Service Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to run your websites and APIs and [Azure App Service Mobile Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/mobile/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to run the backend API for your mobile app that supports functionality like working offline. Also, [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) is part of Azure App Service as you can run an Azure Function on an [App Service Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). 

In this post, we'll discuss 5 relatively unknown things about Azure App Service. 

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)

#### 1. Back up your App Service and your database
When things go wrong, a backup can save you. You can use a backup of your system to restore it to the way it was before things went wrong. In App Service, you can [backup your App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/manage-backup?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), which backs up all its configuration and settings and also its contents, so the entire application that is deployed to the App Service. And, you can also back up services that are connected to the App Service, like an [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) or [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). You can create these backups from the **Backups menu** in your App Service, as you can see in the image below:

#### 2. Test in production
[Deployment slots](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) are a very powerful feature of Azure App Service. They provide additional instances of your service that you can use as test versions of your app or to release with no downtime. Additionally, you can use deployment slots to test in production. When you have a deployment slot configured, you can indicate the percentage of traffic to be routed to the slot. This way, you can, for instance, route 50% of traffic to your deployment slot and 50% to your production slot. This enables you to test a new version of your app to see if and how users use a new feature. You can configure the testing in production feature from the **Deployment slots menu**.

#### 3. Implement authentication without changing code
In Azure, you can secure your application with [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), which enables users in your organization to authenticate to your application. You can also use [Azure Active Directory B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/external-identities/b2c/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to allow users from outside your organization to log into your app using external identities, like a Microsoft or Google account. Implementing this type of security involves making changes to your application and configuration. But, with [Azure App Service Easy Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), you can enable authentication with a flip of a switch, without changing any code. The Easy Authentication feature enables you to configure Azure Active Directory authentication, or authentication with other Identity Providers and creates a security layer between users and your application. When Easy Authentication is enabled, users always have to log in to use your app. You can enable Easy Authentication from the **Authentication / Authorization menu** and configure your authentication method from there.

#### 4. Extend the functionality of you App Service
Your Azure App Service has many capabilities out-of-the-box. But it can do even more. You can extend its functionality by adding [extensions](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-web-sites-extensions/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to it. When you go to the **Extensions menu**, you can install extensions, like extensions for monitoring and logging and extensions for certificate management. And there are also extensions for runtimes that aren't supported by default, like Python.

#### 5. Run MySQL In App
You can run a MySQL database in an App Service by using the [MySQL In App feature](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/MySQL-in-app?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). This creates a MySQL database in the filesystem of the App Service and runs the MySQL process. This works well and is a very cost effective way to run a database. The database stays in your App Service, so this is not a good solution for App Services that you need to scale. You can enable this feature from the **MySQL In App menu** and also configure logging from there. Once it is enabled, you can find the credentials to log into the database in a file called **MYSQLCONNSTR_localdb.ini**, which you can find in the filesystem of the App Service in the **home/data/mysql folder**. You can access the filesystem through FTP of via the KUDU Console.

#### Conclusion
[Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) provides great services to run your applications in. And App Service comes with lots of features, including [backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/manage-backup?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), [testing in production](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev#route-traffic), [Easy authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), [extensions](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-web-sites-extensions/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and [MySQL In App](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/MySQL-in-app?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).
