#### Get the Record Count in Cosmos DB

When working with Azure Cosmos DB, it is guaranteed that at some point that you'll need to get the record count of a document. There are a couple of quick ways of how to do this through the Azure Portal by navigating to the Cosmos DB resource you wish to query and selecting the **Data Explorer** tab and using the following query: `SELECT VALUE COUNT(1) FROM c`

> If you’re wondering about the VALUE keyword – all queries return JSON fragments back. By using VALUE, you can get the scalar value of count e.g., 100, instead of the JSON document {"$1": 100}

You may want to know the **Request Charge** for that query and you can see that by clicking on **Query Information**.

If you compare that to some of the older methods folks used before `COUNT` was available such as `SELECT c.id FROM c` then you'd see that it might be time to update the queries.

If I need to put this logic inside of an application instead of access it through the Azure Portal, here is how I do that in C#. 

First, I create a `app.config` file and add the following appSettings tags.

>You can get the **endpoint** and **authkey** from the **Keys** section in your Cosmos DB blade in the portal. 

```text
<appSettings>
    <add key="endpoint" value="enter" />
    <add key="authkey" value="enter" />
    <add key="database" value="enter" />
    <add key="collection" value="enter" />
  </appSettings>
  ```


```csharp

private static readonly string DatabaseId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["database"];
private static readonly string CollectionId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["collection"];
private static readonly string EndPointId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["endpoint"];
private static readonly string AuthKeyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["authkey"];

private static DocumentClient client;

client = new DocumentClient(new Uri(EndPointId), AuthKeyId);
CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync().Wait();
CreateCollectionIfNotExistsAsync().Wait();

FeedOptions queryOptions = new FeedOptions { MaxItemCount = -1 };

IQueryable<dynamic> familyQueryInSql = client.CreateDocumentQuery<dynamic>(
UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(DatabaseId, CollectionId),
    "SELECT VALUE COUNT(1) FROM c",
    queryOptions);

Console.WriteLine("Running direct SQL query...");
foreach (dynamic family in familyQueryInSql)
{
    Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0}", family);
}

Console.Read();
```

Success!!
