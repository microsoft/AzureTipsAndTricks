### Use VNET peering to connect existing VNETs
 
Recently a question came up about how to securely connect existing VNETs. This got me thinking about how I have VMs deployed in their own VNETs. 

Often when I set up a VM for a demo, I’ll use the default settings, which creates a VNET for each VM. In this post, I’ll walk you through how to set up a [hub-spoke network topology](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to connect existing VNETs.

#### My requirements

* Connect three VNETs, one of which has a Point-to-Site gateway configured
* No public IPs attached to VM network interfaces
* Ability to connect to all VMs

#### How I connect three existing VNETs

I am starting with these resources:

Subscription 1:

* hub-vnet – the VNET with the Point-to-Site VPN configured
    * vnet-gw – the VNET gateway
    * win2016svr-east – VM inside the VNET with no public IP ([Windows Server 2016 DataCenter](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/Microsoft.WindowsServer?tab=Overview))
*	spoke2-vnet – second VNET with no gateway
    o	win10vm2-east – VM inside the VNET with no public IP ([Windows 10 image](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoftwindowsdesktop.windows-10?tab=Overview))
Subscription 2:
*	spoke1-vnet – VNET in another subscription (but same Azure Active Directory)
o	win10vm-east – VM inside the VNET with no public IP ([Windows 10 image](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoftwindowsdesktop.windows-10?tab=Overview))

**Part 1:**

* In the Azure portal, I go to the **hub-vnet virtual network**, select **Peerings**, and click the **Add** button.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/peering2.png')">

* I give the peering the name **hub-spoke2-peer** and **select the subscription** and **virtual network**. Then I check the •	I give the peering the name hub-spoke2-peer and select the subscription and virtual network. Then I check the Allow gateway transit and click the OK button. and click the **OK** button.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/peering3.png')">

Note: **Allow gateway transit** is needed to make the Point-to-Site connection. Otherwise I would need to use a jumpbox.

Once this side of the peering is ready, it will show the status as **Initiated**.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/peering4.png')">

* I repeat the above steps and add the peering for the **hub-spoke1-peer**.

That sets up the hub side of the peering. The next step is the spoke side.

**Part 2:**

* In the Azure portal, I select **Virtual Networks**, select the **spoke2-vnet**, then select **Peerings**.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/peering6.png')">

* Click the **Add** button.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/peering7.png')">

* I give the peering the reverse name **spoke2-hub-peer**, select the **subscription** and **virtual network** of hub-vnet, and check the **Use remote gateway**. Then I click **OK** to create the peering.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/peering8.png')">

Note: **Use remote gateways** is the reverse setting of the one that allows the usage of the gateway in hub-vnet.

* Now I go back to my virtual networks list and repeat for **spoke1-vnet**.

I now have the VNET peerings shown below:

**Part 3:**

To test that I can connect to each of the VMs, I first need to download the VPN client again.

* In the Azure portal, I search for **vnet-gw** and select it from the results, and then select **Point-to-site configuration**.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/peering11.png')">

* Then I click **Download VPN client** and reinstall it once it downloads.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/peering12.png')">

Once I have it reinstalled, I **connect the VPN**.

* I open remote desktop (type **mstsc** at the command prompt or make sure you read [Quickly Connect to Windows VMs with RDP](tip9/)) and, one by one, I verify that I can connect to the private IPs for the VMs:
    * Win2016svr-east: 10.0.0.36
    * Win10vm-east: 10.1.0.68
    * Win10vm2-east: 10.2.0.68

That’s all it takes to connect all three VNETs using VNET peering!
