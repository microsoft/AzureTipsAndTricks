#### Manage Application Settings for Azure Functions within Visual Studio

Generally when I'm working with Azure Functions and Visual Studio and need to add an **Application Setting**, then I'll head over to the Azure Portal, click on my Function, Configuration and add the Application Setting.

Over the weekend I was about to do the same and noticed that you can actually apply Application Settings within the IDE. Just go to **Publish** and then click on **Application Setting**.
