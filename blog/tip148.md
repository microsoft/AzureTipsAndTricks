```text
MyFunctionApp
|     host.json
|____ shared
|     |____ businessLogic.js
|____ function1
|     |____ index.js
|     |____ function.json
|____ function2
      |____ index.js
      |____ function.json
```


In the `shared` folder, you'd create a file named `businessLogic.js` and put your shared code.  

A sample in JS could be the following:

```javascript
module.exports = function (context, req) {
    context.res = {
        body: "<b>Hello World, from Azure Tips and Tricks</b>",
        status: 201,
        headers: {
            'content-type': "text/html"
        }
    };     
    context.done();
};
```
Then you'd create two separate functions called `function1` and `function2`. 

Then in your `function1/index.js` and `function2/index.js`, you would use the following lines of code that reference the shared logic folder and file. 

```javascript
var logic = require("../shared/businessLogic.js");
module.exports = logic;
```

Notice that each function has their own `function.json` file. So here you could define them to be different triggers such as `function1` could be an HTTP Trigger

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ],
  "disabled": false
}
```

and `function2` could be a Timer Trigger

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "myTimer",
      "type": "timerTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "schedule": "0 */5 * * * *"
    }
  ],
  "disabled": false
}
```
