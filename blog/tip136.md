## Quickly Restore your Local Settings File for Azure Functions

If you've ever worked with Azure Functions then no doubt you've seen the `local.settings.json` file before. This file stores app settings, connection strings, etc. for local development. 

It looks like the following to refresh your memory: 

```text
{
  "IsEncrypted": true,
  "Values": {
    "FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION": "VALUE",
    "WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING": "VALUE",
    "WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE": "VALUE",
    "AzureWebJobsDashboard": "VALUE",
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "VALUE",
    "ConsumerKey": "VALUE",
    "ConsumerSecret": "VALUE",
    "OAuthTokenSecret": "VALUE",
    "WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE": "VALUE"
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {}
}
```

This file is also by default **not** checked into source control. If you open your `.gitignore` file you'll see the following: 

```text
## Ignore Visual Studio temporary files, build results, and
## files generated by popular Visual Studio add-ons.

# Azure Functions localsettings file
local.settings.json
```

With this knowledge, you might have a need one day to restore this file (for example, working with the source code on another machine pulled down from source) and you can easily do so. 

Simply install the [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) with `npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools`. 

Navigate to the source code where your Azure Function is and run `func azure account list`. This will ask you to login and you should ensure we are in the proper subscription where your Azure Function exist. You'll see something like the following: 

```text
C:\Users\mbcrump\src\FunctionTest>func azure account list
Subscription                                                                 Current
------------                                                                 -------
Visual Studio Enterprise (xxx)                                               True
Michael's Internal Subscription (xxx)                                        False
```

If you're not in the right subscription then type `func azure account set <subid>` where `subid` is the correct subscription.

Now run `func azure function app fetch-app-settings <functionname>` where `functionname` is your Azure Function and it will restore your `local.settings.json` file!
