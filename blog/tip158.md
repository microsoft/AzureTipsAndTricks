### Create Thumbnail Images with Azure Functions and Azure Storage - Part 2 

In this mini-series, we're going to create an Azure Function that detects when a new image is added to Azure Storage and automatically creates a thumbnail image for us.

* [Azure Tips and Tricks Part 157 - Part 1 Create Thumbnail Images with Azure Functions and Azure Storage](tip157.html)
* [Azure Tips and Tricks Part 158 - Part 2 Create Thumbnail Images with Azure Functions and Azure Storage](tip158.html)

#### Part 3 Time to Code

Make sure you read [Part 1 Create Thumbnail Images with Azure Functions and Azure Storage](tip157.html) before proceeding with this post.

Inside of your Azure Function app in Visual Studio, open your **local.settings.json**, now add the following value of **StorageConnection** with your **ConnectionString** found in the previous part:

```
{
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
        "AzureWebJobsDashboard": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
        "StorageConnection": "Enter Your Access Key From the Previous Part HERE"
  }
}
```

Be sure to include the NuGet package called **ImageResizer**


Copy the following code into your `Function1.cs`:

```csharp
using ImageResizer;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using System.IO;

namespace ImageResizer1
{
    public static class Function1
    {

        [FunctionName("Function1")]
        public static void Run(
            [BlobTrigger("originals/{name}", Connection = "StorageConnection")]Stream image,
            [Blob("thumbs/s-{name}", FileAccess.Write, Connection = "StorageConnection")]Stream imageSmall,
        TraceWriter log)
        {
        var instructions = new Instructions
        {
            Height = 320,
            Width = 200,
            Mode = FitMode.Carve,
            Scale = ScaleMode.Both
        };
        ImageBuilder.Current.Build(new ImageJob(image, imageSmall, instructions));

        log.Info($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{image} \n Size: {image.Length} Bytes");
        }

    }
}
```

Now run the Application by pressing F5 and switch over to the Azure Portal and open your Storage account that you just created. Click on **Blobs** and the **originals** Container and you'll now want to click **Upload** and select a file on your physical disk.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/imageresizer6.png')">

Make note of the filename and check your running Azure Function.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/imageresizer7.png')">

If you switch over to the **thumbs** container, you should see a new file with the format that we specified.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/imageresizer8.png')">

If you click on the filename, you can see the Properties and even Download the file.

Success! We've accomplished this task in the time it would take to watch a 30-minute TV Show.
