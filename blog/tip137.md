#### Export Azure Resources to CSV files with PowerShell

If you've ever had a need to create a CSV file of various Azure Resources for reports, etc. than this post is for you. I'm going to quickly show you how to generate a CSV file with PowerShell that lists VMs in the active subscription along with a couple of additional details.  

Begin by typing `Install-Module -Name AzureRM` and follow along with the prompts below. You may also install the update if you wish, but this should work fine in 5.x.

```powershell
Windows PowerShell

PS C:\Windows\system32> Install-Module -Name AzureRM

NuGet provider is required to continue
PowerShellGet requires NuGet provider version '2.8.5.201' or newer to interact with NuGet-based repositories. The NuGet
 provider must be available in 'C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies' or
'C:\Users\mbcrump\AppData\Local\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies'. You can also install the NuGet provider by
running 'Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force'. Do you want PowerShellGet to install
and import the NuGet provider now?
[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"):

Untrusted repository
You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change its
InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet. Are you sure you want to install the modules from
'PSGallery'?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): Y
WARNING: Version '5.7.0' of module 'AzureRM' is already installed at 'C:\Program
Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\AzureRM\5.7.0'. To install version '6.3.0', run Install-Module and add the -Force
parameter, this command will install version '6.3.0' in side-by-side with version '5.7.0'.
```

Run the `Import-Module AzureRM` command and then type `A` as shown below:

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32> Import-Module AzureRM

Do you want to run software from this untrusted publisher?
File C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\AzureRM\5.7.0\AzureRM.psm1 is published by CN=Microsoft Corporation,
O=Microsoft Corporation, L=Redmond, S=Washington, C=US and is not trusted on your system. Only run scripts from trusted
 publishers.
[V] Never run  [D] Do not run  [R] Run once  [A] Always run  [?] Help (default is "D"): A
```

In case you aren't in the working subscription where you have your resources then you might have to type `Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId <SubId>` where `SubId` is the subscription id that you want to query. 

Now add the following in your PowerShell window. 

```powershell
$VMs = Get-AzureRmVM
$vmOutput = $VMs | ForEach-Object { 
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        "VM Name" = $_.Name
        "VM Type" = $_.StorageProfile.osDisk.osType
        "VM Profile" = $_.HardwareProfile.VmSize
        "VM OS Disk Size" = $_.StorageProfile.OsDisk.DiskSizeGB
        "VM Data Disk Size" = ($_.StorageProfile.DataDisks.DiskSizeGB) -join ','
    }
}
$vmOutput | export-csv C:\Users\mbcrump\data.csv -delimiter ";" -force -notypeinformation
```

You can now open this CSV file in Excel and use a `;` delimeter to format each item into columns.
