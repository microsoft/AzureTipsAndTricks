### Migrating Data from Cosmos DB to Local JSON files

#### Using the Data Migration Tool with Cosmos DB

One tasks that seems to come up over and over is migrating data from one database/format into another. I recently used Cosmos DB as my database to store every tweet that came out of Ignite. Once I had the data and wouldn't be using Cosmos DB any more for that exercise, I needed to dump the data out to a local file to preserve the data and save money. Here is how I did it. 

#### The Tools

Download and install the [Azure DocumentDB Data Migration Tool](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-datamigrationtool)

# Get to Work

Ensure you have a Cosmos DB database and collection created that you wish to migrate out. 

Go to **Keys** (inside your Cosmos DB blade in the portal) to copy the **Primary Connection String**

You'll need to append the Database name to the end of the string. For example `Database=cosmosdb-ignite` will be appended to the **Key** copied earlier `AccountEndpoint=https://mbcrump.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=VxDEcJblah==;Database=cosmosdb-ignite`. Save this for later. 

Open the **Data Migration Tool** and under **Source Information**, select **DocumentDB** as shown below. 

You'll need to add the **ConnectionString** (that we just created) along with the **Collection** and in my case it is `items`. We'll take the defaults on the rest and press **Verify** and if successful, then press **Next**.

In my case, I'll export to a local JSON file and select **Prettify JSON** and press **Next**.

On the next screen, you'll see a **View Command** to see the command that will be used to migrate your data. This is helpful to just learn the syntax. 

<img :src="$withBase('/files/migratingdatafromcosmosdb-3.png')">

<img :src="$withBase('/files/migratingdatafromcosmosdb-4.png')">

You'll finally see the Import has completed with over 100K items transferred in a little under 2 minutes.

We now have our local JSON file and can use it however we want! Awesome!
