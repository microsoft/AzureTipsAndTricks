#### Securing components in your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

By default, components in a Kubernetes cluster can receive traffic from anywhere. This is fine for a development scenario, but not when you run your services in production. To secure your [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum) cluster, you can implement a network policy that defines which components can receive traffic from which sources.

In this post, we'll secure traffic between Kubernetes pods using a network policy.

#### Prerequisites

If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum) before you begin)

#### Secure traffic between pods using network policies

To start securing your Kubernetes components, you need to implement a network policy.

Azure provides two ways to implement a network policy. You choose a network policy option when you create an AKS cluster. The policy option can't be changed after the cluster is created. You can choose between:
* Azure’s own implementation, called **Azure Network Policies**
* [Calico Network Policies](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.8/security/calico-network-policy), an open-source network and network security solution

You can learn more about the differences between these options [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-network-policies#overview-of-network-policy?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum). 

So, to get started, we'll create a new AKS cluster with a network policy:
1. We are going to use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/cloud-shell/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum) to run our scripts. By using this, we make sure that we run the latest version of the Azure CLI. Go to [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum)
2. Run the following script in the Azure Cloud Shell. This creates a virtual network and subnet, an Azure AD Service principal and creates an AKS cluster with **Azure Network Policy** enabled
   a. Replace the values for the **RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME**, **CLUSTER_NAME** and **LOCATION** parameters at the top with your own values

```
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=akstips
CLUSTER_NAME=tipsAndTricksAKSCluster
LOCATION=eastus

# Create a resource group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION

# Create a virtual network and subnet
az network vnet create \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
    --name myVnet \
    --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/8 \
    --subnet-name myAKSSubnet \
    --subnet-prefix 10.240.0.0/16

# Create a service principal and read in the application ID
SP=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac --output json)
SP_ID=$(echo $SP | jq -r .appId)
SP_PASSWORD=$(echo $SP | jq -r .password)

# Wait 15 seconds to make sure that service principal has propagated
echo "Waiting for service principal to propagate..."
sleep 15

# Get the virtual network resource ID
VNET_ID=$(az network vnet show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name myVnet --query id -o tsv)

# Assign the service principal Contributor permissions to the virtual network resource
az role assignment create --assignee $SP_ID --scope $VNET_ID --role Contributor

# Get the virtual network subnet resource ID
SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --vnet-name myVnet --name myAKSSubnet --query id -o tsv)

# Create the AKS cluster and specify the virtual network and service principal information
# Enable network policy by using the `--network-policy` parameter
az aks create \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --node-count 1 \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --network-plugin azure \
    --service-cidr 10.0.0.0/16 \
    --dns-service-ip 10.0.0.10 \
    --docker-bridge-address 172.17.0.1/16 \
    --vnet-subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \
    --service-principal $SP_ID \
    --client-secret $SP_PASSWORD \
    --network-policy azure
```

3. When the AKS cluster is created, run the following command to configure **kubectl** to connect to your Kubernetes cluster:
```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME
```
4. Before we can run example pods to apply network policies to, we need to **create a namespace**. Run the following code to create a namespace called **test**:
```
kubectl create namespace test
kubectl label namespace/test purpose=test
```
5. Now create an example back-end pod that runs [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/). We'll use this back-end pod to simulate a sample back-end web application. The following code creates the pod in the **test** namespace, and opens port 80 to serve web traffic. It also labels the pod with **app=webapp,role=backend** so that we can target it with a network policy in the next section:
```
kubectl run backend --image=nginx --labels app=webapp,role=backend --namespace test --expose --port 80 --generator=run-pod/v1
```
6. Next, create another pod and attach a terminal session to it, to test that we can reach the NGINX webpage:
```
kubectl run --rm -it --image=alpine network-policy --namespace test --generator=run-pod/v1
```
7. At the command prompt, run the following command to try and get the webpage from the other pod. The output should be the HTML of the NGINX pod.
```
wget -qO- http://backend
```
8. Run the **exit** command to stop the terminal session

#### Deny all traffic

1. Remember that by default, all traffic is allowed. So, before we can allow specific network traffic between the pods, we have to create a network policy that denies all traffic. To do this, we start by creating a file that contains YAML code that defines the network policy. Create a new file on your computer called **backend-policy.yaml** and paste the following code into the file. This denies all inbound (ingress) traffic to the pod, because there are no rules defined for **ingress**.
```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: backend-policy
  namespace: test
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webapp
      role: backend
  ingress: []
```
2. In the Azure Cloud Shell, upload the network policy document by clicking the **Upload/Download files button** and selecting the document

(Upload files in the Azure Cloud Shell)

3. Now apply the network policy by running this command:
```
kubectl apply -f backend-policy.yaml
```
#### Test that all traffic is denied

1. Let's test the network policy. Run the following code to create another pod and attach a terminal to it:
```
kubectl run --rm -it --image=alpine network-policy --namespace test --generator=run-pod/v1
```
2. Now run **wget** again to try and get the NGINX webpage. This command should result in **wget: download timed out**
```
wget -qO- --timeout=2 http://backend
```
3. Exit out of the terminal by running the **exit** command

#### Allow specific traffic

Now that all traffic is denied, we can start allowing specific traffic. 
1. Edit the **backend-policy.yaml** and paste the following, new code in. This only allows ingress traffic to pods that match the labels **app:webapp and role: frontend**
```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: backend-policy
  namespace: test
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webapp
      role: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector: {}
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: webapp
          role: frontend
```
2. Upload the new version of the file to the Azure Cloud Shell
3. Apply the new policy by running the following code:
```
kubectl apply -f backend-policy.yaml
```
4. Now run a pod that has the labels **app=webapp,role=frontend** and attach a terminal session with the following code:
```
kubectl run --rm -it frontend --image=alpine --labels app=webapp,role=frontend --namespace test --generator=run-pod/v1
```
5. Test if we can get the HTML of the NGINX webpage with the **wget** command. This should work as the pod that we are using has the labels that are allowed by the network policy:
```
wget -qO- http://backend
```
6. It works! Now exit the terminal by running the **exit** command

<img :src="$withBase('/files/37getnginxpage.png')">

(Successful get of the NGINX webpage in the Azure Cloud Shell)

7. Let's see if the network policy actually works. Let's create a pod that doesn't have the allowed labels and get the webpage from there:
```
kubectl run --rm -it --image=alpine network-policy --namespace test --generator=run-pod/v1

wget -qO- --timeout=2 http://backend
```
This doesn't work and times out. This means that the network policy is working.

8. Exit the terminal with the **exit** command
