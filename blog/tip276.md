#### Making sense of Azure

Azure is a big place and it is constantly evolving. This is great, because it means that you'll be able to use a service or feature that suits your specific scenario. But it can also be difficult to keep up with the huge world of Azure, to make sure that you know what you should use for your scenario. 

In this post, we'll highlight the top 10 Azure resources that can help you to stay up-to-date with Azure. 

#### [1. The Developer’s Guide to Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/campaigns/developer-guide?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum)
The first resource is [The Developer's Guide to Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/campaigns/developer-guide?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum). This is a **free** e-book that gets you started with Azure, guides you through different scenarios and walkthroughs and helps you to choose the right Azure services for your scenario.

#### [2. The Azure Readiness Checklist](https://azurechecklist.com?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-micrum)
Next up is the [Azure Readiness Checklist](https://azurechecklist.com?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-micrum). This is a **free** website that helps you to build checklists for onboarding onto Azure. On the website, you can save a checklist that you run down to, for instance, implement high-availability in Azure.

#### [3. Microsoft Learn - Introduction to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/azure?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-micrum)
You can learn Azure skills for **free** at [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/azure?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-micrum). This is a free website from Microsoft that contains many Azure courses, hands-on labs and tests that help you to learn Azure (and other Microsoft technologies, like .NET). You can easily get to relevant content by selecting your role (Developer, Architect, DevOps, etc.) and by following Learning Paths that guide you through topics.

#### [4. Azure Friday](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/videos/azure-friday?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum)
A great way to stay up-to-date with Azure is to watch [Azure Friday](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/videos/azure-friday?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum).

[Azure Health Status](https://status.azure.com/status?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum) tells you if there are any problems with Azure Services around the world. It provides a detailed table of all Azure services and their health status. You can also drill down into your personalized [Azure Service Health](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/service-health?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum), which is a feature in the Azure portal that tells you the health status of the Azure services that you own.

Another good way to stay on top of things is by using the [Azure updates website](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-micrum). This shows the latest updates from the various Azure teams, which include product- and roadmap updates and announcements. You can also subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/updates/feed?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-micrum) of this website, so that you can receive the updates in your favorite RSS reader.
