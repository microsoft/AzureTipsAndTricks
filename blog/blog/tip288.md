### How to Configure Advanced Threat Protection in Azure SQL Database

#### Secure your data with Azure SQL Databases
One of the most widely-used services in Azure is [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). It is great for storing relational data and making sure that the data is secure, scalable and reliably stored and backed up. All without having to manage any infrastructure, as Azure manages that for you. 

On top of that, Azure SQL Database comes with many advanced features out of the box, like [geo-replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/active-geo-replication-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev ), [automatic performance tuning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/automatic-tuning-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev ) and [advanced threat protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/threat-detection-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). And that last one is the feature that we will configure in this post. 

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* An Azure SQL Database Server. You can create one [using this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)

#### Configure Advanced Threat Protection in Azure SQL Database
We'll start with an existing Azure SQL Database Server and configure advanced threat protection for it. Threat protection is a feature that you enable for the complete server and all of the databases in it. 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), go to the Azure SQL Database Server
2. Select **Advanced Data Security** from the menu

3. Set Advanced Data Security to **On**
4. You can choose to let it run a vulnerability assessment every week and send the reports to you
5. In the **Advanced Threat Protection Settings** section, you can provide an e-mail address that you'll receive alerts on when threat protection finds any vulnerabilities or detects a security anomaly. Also, you can check the box to let this e-mail be sent to admins and subscription owners
6. Select **Advanced Threat Protection types**. In here, you can select which types of threats you want to be detected. Select the threat types you want to monitor and select **OK** to go back.

7. Back in the advanced data security blade, select **Save** to save your configuration
8. To enhance your security and make it easier to troubleshoot threats, you can enable **Auditing**. Go to **Auditing** in the menu to enable it

9. Turn it **On**
10. Select and configure a place **to store the audit logs**, like in Azure Storage
11. Select **Save** to enable Auditing

That's it. Advanced Threat protection is now enabled and will alert you when it detects security threats or anomalies. 

#### Conclusion
[Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) allows you to easily configure [Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/threat-detection-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), which detects security anomalies and threats and let's you know about them. Go and check it out!
