### How to use PowerShell in Azure Data Studio

#### Azure Data Studio

Managing data in Azure is a very frequent task for most Azure developers. [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/what-is?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) is a great, free, cross-platform tool to do just that. Azure Data Studio offers a modern editor experience for managing data across multiple sources with fast intellisense, code snippets, source control integration, and an integrated terminal.

And now, you can use [PowerShell in Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/powershell-extension?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). This means that you can reuse your PowerShell skills and that you can execute your favorite scripts.

In this post, we'll explore how to get started with using PowerShell in Azure Data Studio. 

#### Prerequisites

If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* Azure Data Studio. You can download a free copy [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
* Make sure that you have the latest version of PowerShell Core installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/?WT.mc_id=code-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)

#### Use PowerShell with Azure Data Studio

To get started with PowerShell in Azure Data Studio, we need to install the PowerShell extension.

1. Open **Azure Data Studio** as an administrator and click on the **extensions** menu
2. In "**extensions**", search for **PowerShell**
3. Click on the PowerShell extension result
4. Click on **install** to install the extension

Now that we have the PowerShell extension installed, let's use it. We'll create a new file that will create an Azure SQL Server and Database.

1. In Azure Data Studio, open the terminal (View > Terminal)

<img :src="$withBase('/files/41terminal.png')">

(Terminal in Azure Data Studio)

2. We are going to run some PowerShell commands to interact with Azure. Before we can do that, we need to make sure that we have the Azure PowerShell modules installed. Run the following commands in the terminal:

```powershell
Install-Module Az
Import-Module Az
```

3. Next, create a new PowerShell file and open it in the editor. You can do that by running the following command in the terminal: 

```powershell
New-EditorFile CreateNewSQL.ps1
```

4. Paste the script below into the newly created .ps1 file. This script logs into Azure, creates a resource group and creates an Azure SQL Server and a database in it. 

```powershell
# login to Azure
Connect-AzAccount

# Set the resource group name and location for your server
$resourceGroupName = "myResourceGroup-$(Get-Random)"
$location = "westeurope"
# Set an admin login and password for your server
$adminSqlLogin = "SqlAdmin"
$password = "ChangeYourAdminPassword1"
# Set server name - the logical server name has to be unique in the system
$serverName = "server-$(Get-Random)"
# The sample database name
$databaseName = "mySampleDatabase"
# The ip address range that you want to allow to access your server
$startIp = "0.0.0.0"
$endIp = "255.255.255.255"

# Create a resource group
$resourceGroup = New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location $location

# Create a server with a system wide unique server name
$server = New-AzSqlServer -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -ServerName $serverName `
    -Location $location `
    -SqlAdministratorCredentials $(New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $adminSqlLogin, $(ConvertTo-SecureString -String $password -AsPlainText -Force))

# Create a server firewall rule that allows access from the specified IP range
$serverFirewallRule = New-AzSqlServerFirewallRule -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -ServerName $serverName `
    -FirewallRuleName "AllowedIPs" -StartIpAddress $startIp -EndIpAddress $endIp

# Create a blank database with an S0 performance level
$database = New-AzSqlDatabase  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -ServerName $serverName `
    -DatabaseName $databaseName `
    -RequestedServiceObjectiveName "S0" `
    -SampleName "AdventureWorksLT"

# Clean up deployment 
# Remove-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
```

5. The PowerShell extension adds functionality to better work with PowerShell in Azure Data Studio. For instance, when you hover over a PowerShell commandlet, you can see its definition. Try it out by hovering over the first line of the script (Connect-AzAccount)

6. The PowerShell extension also analyzes PowerShell in the editor and tells you if there are any problems with it. Take a look in the terminal window, under the **PROBLEMS** tab. In the image below, there are 4 problems in the **PROBLEMS** tab.

7. In Azure Data Studio, you can run a line of a script in the editor by pressing F8. Let's run the complete script. Select all the text of the script and press F8 to execute it
8. The first line of the script (Connect-AzAccount) will log into your Azure account. Click on the link in the output of the terminal and follow the instructions to log in. Once logged in, the script will continue to run
9. After a while, the script is done. To use the database from Azure Data Studio, you need to add your Azure account to it. The login that you just performed, was only for the PowerShell process, not for the Azure Data Studio itself. 
   1. Click on the **connections** menu
   2. In the Azure tab, click on **Sign into Azure...**
   3. Click on the **Add an Account** button

    (Add Azure account to Azure Data Studio)

   4. Follow the instructions by opening the link and pasting in the user code and authenticating to the same Azure account that you used earlier
10. After logging into Azure, you can drill into your subscription to find the newly created SQL Database. **Click on it** to connect with it
11. You are now asked to provide credentials to log in. By default, the script uses the username **SqlAdmin** with the password **ChangeYourAdminPassword1**. Fill these in and connect to the database. You'll be able to connect to the database without adding your client IP address to the SQL Server firewall. This is because the script adds a firewall rule that allows all IP addresses to access the server. If you intend to use this script for production purposes, you need to remove this and change the server credentials
12. Now that you are connected to the database, you can drill down into its tables and perform typical SQL tasks, like querying data, like in the image below:

#### Conclusion
[Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/what-is?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) is a really powerful tool for working with data. The [PowerShell extension for Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/powershell-extension?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) gives you the power to use your PowerShell skills in the world of data. It helps you by adding debug support, auto-complete, script problem analytics, function definition and more. Go and check it out!
